# Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm on Iris Dataset

The objective of this task is to build a Decision Tree classifier, which is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. The model will be trained using a labeled dataset, with the goal of accurately predicting the class of any new data that is fed into it. Once the model is trained, a visual representation of the Decision Tree will be generated to help better understand the decision-making process of the model. This visualization can also aid in identifying areas of the model that may need improvement or refinement. The Decision Tree classifier can be used in various applications, such as fraud detection, disease diagnosis, and customer segmentation, among others, where accurate classification of new data is crucial for making informed decisions.
