# Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset-Terrorism :

The objective is to analyze a dataset to uncover patterns and insights that may help identify regions or locations that are at a high risk of terrorist activities. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed, which involves examining the data from various angles and using visual and statistical techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies. The analysis is carried out with the perspective of a security/defense analyst, who is interested in identifying areas that may require heightened security measures or targeted interventions to mitigate the risk of terrorism. The insights gained from the EDA can help inform decisions on resource allocation and deployment, policy formulation, and threat assessment, among other things. The ultimate goal is to enhance the security and safety of individuals and communities by identifying and mitigating the risks of terrorism.
