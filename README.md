# Data Science Internship
This collection of tasks is comprised of the work I completed throughout my internship at the LetsGrowMore Virtual Internship Program.

   ### Task 1 - Iris Flower Classification

   - The dataset comprises numerical attributes, which makes it a suitable choice for those starting to learn about supervised machine learning algorithms and data manipulation.

   - Classifies iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on measurements of their sepal and petal length and width 

   - The dataset consists of 150 instances, with 50 instances for each species.

   - Dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

   ### Task 2- Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism     
   
   - Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’. 
   
   - As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism. 
  
   - What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?
  
   - You can choose any of the tool of your choice 
     (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)

   ### Task 3 - Prediction using Decision Tree  Algorithm 

   - Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 

   - The purpose is to predict the right class accordingly, when fed with any new data to this classifier.

   - A visual representation of the Decision Tree will be generated to help better understand the decision-making process of the model

   ### Task 4 - Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting using Stacked LSTM

   - Create a robust model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), with a particular emphasis on the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture.

   - The model will be trained on a dataset of historical stock market data to learn from the patterns and relationships in the data. The trained model will then be used to forecast future stock market values.

   - By utilizing an LSTM-based RNN model, this project aims to provide accurate predictions that will be useful for making informed investment decisions and managing risks.
